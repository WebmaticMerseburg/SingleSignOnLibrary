Disclaimer
--------

I am by no means a security expert. I'm not bad at it either, but I cannot vouch for the security of this bundle.
You can use this in production if you want, but please do so at your own risk.
That said, if you'd like to contribute to make this bundle better/safer, you can always [create an issue](https://github.com/korotovsky/SingleSignOnLibrary/issues) or send [a pull request](https://github.com/korotovsky/SingleSignOnLibrary/pulls).

Description
